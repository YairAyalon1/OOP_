# OOP
Object oriented programing using threads to increase the program's efficiency and to check it.
 
This project includes 3 file:
1. Header file where all the classes are defined. Note that the classes are defined in a template and the variable are T, means that they are all defined in the main.cpp file.

2. Source file - where all the methods themselves are defined. There are 5 methods - sum, substract, multiply, diviation, and average calculation.

3. main.cpp file where the program itself defined. There are 4 function which are defined in order to compare the program performance witouht threads and with 1 / 2 / 5 threads. To compare the performance in much more relaiable way, there are some for loops inside the function to increase the execution time of the program.
